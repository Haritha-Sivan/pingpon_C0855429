Abstract:
Ping-pong game developed in python 3 is mainly focussed on analysing the learning capacity of an AI. We are using Gym, Pickle and NumPy as the main libraries. Initially the system will win the game and slowly the AI will pick up by learning the methods and then the winning percentage increases gradually.  We are using Time library to import parameters to calculate the time consumed to play the game for each neuron and learning rate combination.
